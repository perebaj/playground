# playground

Playground is a repository for a lazy programmer.
Here I will put some snippets of code, to save time in the future and also to help other people.

Sometimes, in complex environments, it's really hard to find the root cause of a problem, or create a save place to test new ideas. Here
I'm also put some code that help me to improve this workflow.
